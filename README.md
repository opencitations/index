# OpenCitations: Index

This software allows the creation of indexes of open citations (e.g. COCI).
## Requirements
### Mandatory
- Python 3.7+
- libzip, see [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/nih-at/libzip/blob/master/INSTALL.md) from official repository for additional information.
### Optional
- Redis (* mandatory for redis data source), see [Installing Redis](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/) for additional information.
## Install
To install the index software you must first meet all the requirements above.

1. First of all let's compile the cpp source files for the OCI lookup management
```console
$ make build
```
2. Then install the binaries and add them to the $PATH
```console
$ sudo make install
```
3. As a last step the python package must be installed, at the same time all the python scripts will be added to the $PATH
```console
$ pip install .
```

4. To ensure that the installation has been carried out correctly start the tests
```console
$ python -m unittest discover -s ./index/python/test -p "test_*.py"
```

Done, enjoy :)

## Configuration
By default when index is installed a configuration file is created in ~/.opencitations/index/, namely config.ini. For more information about the semantics of the settings see [config.ini](config.ini).
